            Here are the things that I need to know perfectly.
            Practice the list in order every marathond day

1) Build Spring boot app:
            * Rest API 
            * Spring Data JPA 
            * 3 Tests - @SpringBootTest, @DataJpaTest, @WebMvcTest

2) Streams (May be update scenarios) check Examples package:

    Deduplicate objects by a specific field (keep first occurrence)
    Group objects by a key and collect only one field from each object
    Partition a collection based on a predicate
    Find top N elements using sorting and limiting
    Find the maximum element per group
    Sort objects using multiple comparator conditions
    Find the most frequently occurring element in a collection
    Compute sum of squares of filtered elements
    Perform a custom reduction without using built-in collectors
    Flatten a nested collection, remove duplicates, and sort
    Extract unique words from a list of sentences
    Implement a custom Collector
    Compute average values per group
    Safely retrieve the first matching element using Optional
    Validate a collection using allMatch, anyMatch, and noneMatch
