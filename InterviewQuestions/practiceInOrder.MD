2) Create deadlock and starvation
3) Custom comparator
4) Bubble search
5) Merge search
6) Java 9 features ()

8) java 21 features ()
9) 9 Design patterns (3 createonal, 3 structural, 3 behaviour)
10) Custom functional interface pass to lambda
11) Inner class, anonymous classes
12) All java streams :   
    Filter even numbers — keep only numbers divisible by 2
    Convert strings to uppercase — map each string to uppercase
    Count strings starting with "A" — count items matching a prefix
    Find first number > 10 — return the first number above a threshold
    Distinct + sorted — remove duplicates and sort the result
    ✅ Medium
    Sum of squares — square each number and sum them
    List → Map (name → length) — convert list of names into a map
    Group words by length — group strings based on their size
    Find longest string — find max-length element using streams
    Join strings — join items into one string with a separator
    People older than 18 — filter objects and return only their names
    ✅ Advanced
    Partition adults/kids — split list into two lists based on age
    Find duplicates — return elements that appear more than once
    Flatten nested lists — convert List<List<T>> to List<T>
    Word frequency map — count how many times each word appears
    Max salary per department — group employees and pick highest salary
    Custom collector (reverse) — build a reversed string using Collector
    Parallel sum — compute sum using parallel stream and discuss impact
13) 
14) ExecutorService and thread pools,Callable and Runnable interfaces,Future
15) 
16) Nested classes, static classes, anonimous classes, nested interface
17) Notify and NotifyAll




    Spring

1) Create a spring boot app which has APIs and can save data to H2 using spring data.
2) Create service (Not just directly call repository from controller)
3) Create Create,Update,List,FindBy,Delete apis
4) Implement @Transactional annotation
5) Secure api using spring security auth token
6) All tests, how to test Restcontroller, @Spy, how to test repository - how to test endpoint that I added ?
7) Connect spring data to a table with composite key
8) Type http://localhost:8080 myself
