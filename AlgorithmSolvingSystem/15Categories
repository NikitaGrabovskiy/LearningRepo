                                    Document Each type and subtype

1️⃣ Arrays & Hashing
2️⃣ Two Pointers
            Opposite-direction pointers (left ↔ right)
            Same-direction pointers (fast & slow)
            Fixed-size window (two pointers)
            Variable-size window (sliding window)
            Multiple pointers (e.g., 3Sum / N-Sum)
3️⃣ Sliding Window
            Fixed-size sliding window
            Variable-size (dynamic) sliding window
            Sliding window with frequency map
            Sliding window with monotonic deque
            Sliding window with at-most / at-least constraint

4️⃣ Stack / Monotonic Stack
5️⃣ Binary Search
6️⃣ Linked List
7️⃣ Trees – DFS / BFS
            DFS (Depth-First Search)
            Preorder traversal
            Inorder traversal
            Postorder traversal
            Recursive DFS
            Iterative DFS (using stack)

            BFS (Breadth-First Search)
            Level-order traversal
            Zigzag level-order traversal
            BFS using queue
            Multi-source BFS (tree variants)

8️⃣ Backtracking
            Backtracking is a technique where you:
            1. Choose an option
            2. Explore further
            3. Undo the choice
            4. Try the next option

            🧠 Core idea (one sentence)
            Try all possibilities, and backtrack (undo) when a path doesn’t work.

9️⃣ Heap / Priority Queue
🔟 Intervals
1️⃣1️⃣ Greedy
1️⃣2️⃣ Dynamic Programming
            Dynamic Programming solves problems by breaking them into overlapping
            subproblems and reusing results instead of recomputing them.
1️⃣3️⃣ Graphs
1️⃣4️⃣ Bit Manipulation
1️⃣5️⃣ Union Find
