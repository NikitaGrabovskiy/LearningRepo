                    Long term goal - solve 300 algorithms on leetcode

Save all the interesting ones out of the 300 into files, print them and repeat them periodically one by one.

Do it in batches by 28 (14, one of each category + 14).

                    1. Solve the 28 problems and save to text files (Do not save easy ones)
                    2. Code all of them again
                    3. Print and repeat periodically
                    4. Go to the next one


                   Do it till I reach 300,
                   after that repeat ones that I did once a week and do 1 every week.
